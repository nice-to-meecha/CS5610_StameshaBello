            Task 1: Header
                Use existing HTML tags to create a new header.  This header
                should stretch completely across the screen, and as users
                scroll up and down the page the header should remain at the
                top of the page.  When the page loads, it should not cover
                any content on the page, though it may cover content as users
                scroll down.  The header should be filled with a single solid
                color of your choosing, and should have your name centered
                (horizontally and vertically) in the header.  All other
                attributes (height, etc.) can be determined by you. Tip: you
                will not need to use the <header> tag, but may play with it
                if you choose to.
