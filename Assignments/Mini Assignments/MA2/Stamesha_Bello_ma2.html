            Task 1: Header
                Use existing HTML tags to create a new header.  This header
                should stretch completely across the screen, and as users
                scroll up and down the page the header should remain at the
                top of the page.  When the page loads, it should not cover
                any content on the page, though it may cover content as users
                scroll down.  The header should be filled with a single solid
                color of your choosing, and should have your name centered
                (horizontally and vertically) in the header.  All other
                attributes (height, etc.) can be determined by you. Tip: you
                will not need to use the <header> tag, but may play with it
                if you choose to.

            Task 2: Flex (most important CSS concept)
                Create 100 boxes using HTML and CSS.  These boxes should be
                different colors (at least 3), and a different color from the
                header (so you can copy and paste the same box 100 times.)
                Using CSS flex, put the boxes into 3 different columns that
                are equally spaced apart.  The final row should not shrink or
                stretch out: all boxes should be uniform, even if there are not
                enough to complete a final row.

            Task 3: Table
                At the bottom of the page, add a table that includes at least
                2 ways to contact you: one column should say what form of
                contact this is (email, phone number, Github, school email,
                etc), the other is the actual information.  If you don’t have
                this information or don’t wish to share it in this project, you
                are welcome to use fake data.

        Task 1 - 10 Points

        Well Formatted HTML and CSS - 5 points

        Task 1: Header 
        Use existing HTML tags to create a new header.  This header should stretch completely across the screen,
        and as users scroll up and down the page the header should remain at the top of the page.  When the page
        loads, it should not cover any content on the page, though it may cover content as users scroll down.
        The header should be filled with a single solid color of your choosing, and should have your name centered
        (horizontally and vertically) in the header.  All other attributes (height, etc.) can be determined by you.
        Tip: you will not need to use the <header> tag, but may play with it if you choose to.

        Task 2: Flex Columns 
        Create 100 boxes using HTML and CSS.  These boxes should be different colors (at least 3), and a different
        color from the header (so you can copy and paste the same box 100 times.)  Using CSS flex, put the boxes
        into 3 different columns that are equally spaced apart.  The final row should not shrink or stretch out:
        all boxes should be uniform, even if there are not enough to complete a final row.

        Task 3: Table with Contact Information
        At the bottom of the page, add a table that includes at least 2 ways to contact you: one column should say
        what form of contact this is (email, phone number, Github, school email, etc), the other is the actual
        information.  If you don’t have this information or don’t wish to share it in this project, you are welcome
        to use fake data.

        Well Formatted HTML and CSS
            Your HTML and CSS must be readable and understandable.  This means:
                HTML lines should not be too long (if an element has more than 2 attributes, they should each have their own line
                Class and ID names should be explicit (for example, ‘MainBlueHeader’ is better than ‘blue’)
                All CSS must be in the style tag (none should be in the HTML)

        Deliverables
            Submit a SINGLE HTML document containing both your HTML and CSS to Canvas before the start of the
            next class.  Please name your file {firstname}_{lastname}_ma2.html (leave out the curly brackets.)
