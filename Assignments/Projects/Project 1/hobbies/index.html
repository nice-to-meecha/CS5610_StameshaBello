                        I've found that I truly enjoy finding different furniture pieces and
                        arranging them within a space. It's fascinating to see how much one
                        simple room can change, based on the elements you've added to it.

                        This image showcases a studio apartment I decorated digitally months ago,
                        when I had some spare time.

                    <h4>Webcomics</h4>
                    <p>
                        One of the things I love to do most is read webcomics. There are so many
                        worlds that just come alive with words and still images. With webcomics,
                        you get a much more vivid picture of what the author had in mind, yet you
                        also still get to imagine what happens between panels, what the characters
                        sounds like, and a variety of other things. It truly offers a unique experience
                        that I haven't yet found anywhere else.
                        <br />
                        I'm currently reading ___. I usually like traditional rom-coms, but this
                        one has so much drama I hadn't anticipated. I guess I like drama. ðŸ˜…

                    <h4>3D Modeling</h4>
                    <p>
                        I love the idea of crafting beautiful things -- whether physical or digital --
                        with my own two hands. (Unfortunately, this website didn't quite make the cut. ðŸ¥²) 
                        I think 3D models can be absolutely breath-taking, and I aspire to create an
                        animated short that gives any viewers that same feeling.
                        <br />
                        This image comes from one of the best 3D models I've seen so far.
