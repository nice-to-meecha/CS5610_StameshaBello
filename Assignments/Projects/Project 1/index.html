            Required HTML/CSS Elements

            Navbar
                A core feature of your site should be a navbar, so that users
                can easily access all information:
                    - It should stay in the same position, no matter where the
                      user has scrolled
                    - It should contain links to each of the pages above. 
                      Additionally, when a user is on that page, you should use
                      styling to indicate that that is where the user is
                      currently looking.
                    - It should have a title that references your name
                    - It should not cover any content, unless the user has
                      scrolled down the page
                    - Hint: consider using CSS aspects like transitions and
                      pseudo-elements (e.g., :hover) to artfully dynamically
                      modify the size of your navbar

            Mobile friendly design
                Your website should look equally as good when on a mobile phone
                or desktop computer.  Some considerations:
                    - You may need to modify your navbar so that it shows as much
                      space as possible.   
                    - All content should be equally accessible whether a user is
                      on desktop or mobile
                    - Text, images and other content should shrink and grow so
                      that it is easier to see
                    - Idea: it might be a good idea to move the navbar (say from
                      the side to the bottom of the screen) when the user is in
                      mobile or browser view.

            Use of the certain HTML Components
                Your website should should use, at least once, each of the
                following HTML elements:
                    - div
                    - span
                    - a
                    - img
                    - p
                    - head
                    - body
                    - h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 or h6
                    - ul or ol or table
                Additionally, make sure that your idâ€™s and classes are well named,
                    as any poorly or carelessly named content may result in a
                    lower score. 
                Finally, you should ensure that there is little to no raw HTML on
                    your page: everything should be styled in some capacity.

            Use of certain CSS properties and features
                You website should use, at least once, each of the following
                CSS properties or features:
                    - font-family
                    - background-color or background
                    - margin
                    - padding
                    - position
                    - align-items or text-align
                    - flex
                    - grid
                    - @media queries
                    - You must use at least two different pseudo-elements
                      (e.g., :hover, :first-child, etc.)
                    - transition/transform

            Good and professional design
                Finally, it is important that you have a web design that is both
                easy for users to navigate but also interesting to keep people
                engaged.  Some considerations:
                    - Think about how your colors and fonts relate to each other.
                      It is good if these do not class, but rather make it easy
                      for users to use your site.
                    - Consider importing a font for an easy way to make your
                      website standout.  What font do you find more readable on a
                      computer screen?
                    - How are you branding your page?  Consider including pieces
                      like SVG icons to make your site look more professional
                    - Imagine how a user would navigate your page
                    - Experiment with spacing and grid so that your site is well
                      organized
                    - You can even consider working out of the box a bit: adding
                      icons that update when users interact; modify the scroll
                      bar so it fits with your theme
                Please know that I understand that this is NOT a design course,
                but the intention is that you can create something to document
                your professional experience and share with recruiters,
                colleagues or others.
