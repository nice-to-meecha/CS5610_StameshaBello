1. What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find
   it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this
   overall assignment take you?
   
   Trying to determine the layout for everything took the most time.
   I spent a decent amount of time trying to figure out how to resize
   grid rows, upon hovering its child elements, only to realize that
   I would be better served by utilizing a flex column instead.

2. What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?

3. What did you take into account when you developed the *design* of your
   website?  Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?

   Maybe 12 1/2 or so.
