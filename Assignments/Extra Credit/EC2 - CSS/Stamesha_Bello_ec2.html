            Create 3 squares that have at least 3 of the following properties:
                Outstanding:
                    - Is fixed in the center of the browser screen (use Lorem Ipsum to generate a bunch of text for your page)
                    - The squares have 20px space in between each of them
                Finished:
                    - The squares are in a horizontal row, not a vertical column
                    - When you hover over the square, the color of square changes from red to green
                    - Has a purple border but when the screen is less than 600px wide, the border disappears
