            <h2>Quick hummus recipe</h2>

            <p>
                This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from <br />
                a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. <br />
                It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.
            </p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
                <li>175g of tahini</li>
                <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
                <li>Half a red pepper</li>
                <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
                <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
                <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
                <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
                <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
                        <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and <br />
                coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta <br />
                cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
            </p>

            <h3>Storage</h3>

            <p>
                Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use <br />
                it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should <br />
                definitely discard it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple <br />
                of months.
            </p>
